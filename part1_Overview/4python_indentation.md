Python Indentation

--Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line in loops and conditional statements.

---In c/c++ we used to add curly braces {} for Conditional formatting, but in case of python we have to add indentation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example1[If statement]:
if 5 > 2:
   print("Five is greater than two!")
---
 |--------this spacing is known as indentation which is used instead of {}.
          The space is exactly the space given by Tab key of our keyboard.
  
You can learn it practically in 'd4.py'

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example2[This one is wrong to make you understand about importance of indentation]:

if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two!")
---
 |--------Here is no indentation, so this code will give indentaion error.
